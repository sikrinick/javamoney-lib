/**
 * Future Value (FV) is a formula used in finance to calculate the value of a cash flow at a later
 * date than originally received. This idea that an amount today is worth a different amount than at
 * a future time is based on the time value of money. The time value of money is the concept that an
 * amount received earlier is worth more than if the same amount is received at a later time. For
 * example, if one was offered $100 today or $100 five years from now, the idea is that it is better
 * to receive this amount today. The opportunity cost for not having this amount in an investment or
 * savings is quantified using the future value formula. If one wanted to determine what amount they
 * would like to receive one year from now in lieu of receiving $100 today, the individual would use
 * the future value formula. See example at the bottom of the page. The future value formula also
 * looks at the effect of compounding. Earning .5% per month is not the same as earning 6% per year,
 * assuming that the monthly earnings are reinvested. As the months continue along, the next month's
 * earnings will make additional monies on the earnings from the prior months. For example, if one
 * earns interest of $40 in month one, the next month will earn interest on the original balance
 * plus the $40 from the previous month. This is known as compound interest.
